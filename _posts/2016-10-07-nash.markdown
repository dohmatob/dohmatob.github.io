In our OPT2016 NIPS workshop <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1507.07901">paper</a>,
we propose a simple projection-free primal-dual algorithm for computing approxi-
mate Nash-equilibria in two-person zero-sum sequential games with incomplete
information and perfect recall (like Texas Holdâ€™em Poker). Our algorithm is numer-
ically stable, performs only basic iterations (i.e matvec multiplications, clipping,
etc., and no calls to external first-order oracles, no matrix inversions, etc.), and is
applicable to a broad class of two-person zero-sum games including simultaneous
games and sequential games with incomplete information and perfect recall. The ap-
plicability to the latter kind of games is thanks to the sequence-form representation
which allows one to encode such a game as a matrix game with convex polytopial
strategy profiles. We prove that the number of iterations needed to produce a Nash-
equilibrium with a given precision is inversely proportional to the precision. We
present experimental results on matrix games on simplexes and Kuhn Poker.

## Concluding remarks
Making use of the sequence-form representation, we have
proposed an equivalent Generalized Saddle-Point (GSP) formulation to
the Nash-equilibrium problem for sequential games with incomplete
information and perfect recall (e.g Texas Hold'em, etc.). Then, we
have devised a simple numerically stable primal-dual algorithm for
solving the GSP, and so by equivalence, compute (approximate)
Nash-equilibria for such games. Our algorithm is simple to implement,
with a low constant cost per iteration, and enjoys a rigorous
convergence theory with a proven $\mathcal{O}(1/\epsilon)$ convergence
in terms of basic operations (matvec products, clipping, etc.), to a
Nash $(\epsilon,0)$-equilibrium of the game. On an experimental footing,
this is just preliminary works, and in future we plan to run
more experiments on real Poker games to measure the practical power of
the proposed algorithm compared to state-of-the-art methods like CFR and variants
 and first-order methods like Andrew Gilpin's.
